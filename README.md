# Personal Website Project

Iâ€™m currently building a personal website for my portfolio.
At the moment, it features a demo member application,
but I plan to add more features and content over time.

You can check out the current version here: [https://www.heri-tny.my.id/demo-member](https://www.heri-tny.my.id/demo-member)

The project is divided into three main components:

- **demo-member-api**: The backend of the website
- **website**: The frontend of the website
- **demo-member-data-generator**: A tool that generates sample member data in Excel format
